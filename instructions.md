# Personal Protective Equipment: Object Detection Image Browser

## Background

This project demonstrates the [YOLOv3 object detection](https://pjreddie.com/publications/) technology using a custom dataset of images containing safety vests and hard hats, packaged into an interactive [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io) app. The neural network was trained using transfer learning by using pre-trained weights from [Darknet YOLOv3](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/)

This project was created using the [Streamlit demo-self-driving](https://github.com/streamlit/demo-self-driving) as a template. The neural network model was trained using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) to take advantage of the free GPU acceleration.

Hosting this Streamlit app allows multiple stakeholders easily see their model's performance without programming.

## Applications

Keep employees safe in construction and manufacturing environments by determining if they are wearing the appropriate safety equipment to perform their jobs.

The model can be configured to detecting [foreign object debris (FOD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_object_damage) to maintain a flightline or factory environment.
