# Personal Protective Equipment: Object Detection Image Browser

This project demonstrates the [YOLO object detection](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo) using a custom dataset of images containing different types of personal protective equipment into an interactive [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io) app.

This project was created using the [Streamlit demo-self-driving](https://github.com/streamlit/demo-self-driving) as a template. The image dataset and neural network have been modified for the specific application of detecting PPE. One potential application of this model would be to detect if construction workers or manufacturing employees are wearing the appropriate safety equipment to perform their jobs while in a dangerous work environment.
