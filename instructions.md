# Personal Protective Equipment: Object Detection Image Browser

## Background

This project demonstrates the [YOLO object detection](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo) using a custom dataset of images containing different types of personal protective equipment and packaged into an interactive [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io) app.

This project was created using the [Streamlit demo-self-driving](https://github.com/streamlit/demo-self-driving) as a template. The image dataset and neural network have been modified for the specific application of detecting PPE.

The neural network model was trained using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) to take advantage of the free GPU acceleration.

## Applications

One potential application of this model would be to detect if construction workers or manufacturing employees are wearing the appropriate safety equipment to perform their jobs while in a dangerous work environment.
